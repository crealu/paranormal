### Stack
Node.js, Express, D3.js,

This project uses the geometric data stored in topo.json to render SVG elements using D3.
When a state is clicked, the sidebar menu populates with a list of haunted places within that state.
Clicking on each location will reveal a detailed description of why it is haunted and an option
to open that location in Google Maps.
